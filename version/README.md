## Version spoof

For some specific* reason Sketch does not allow a file to open with (version)
lower then currently used version to save file. I was simply interested what was
behind all that specification, so the story.

## Introduction

I've used two different version of SketchApp to save file and investigate
further information. Approach I took is to examine the file from perspective of
a blob since no prior information did I have about them.
  
Some resource may be found on interwebz about this file and these are referenced
at the end of the file.
